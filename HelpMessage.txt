Usage: %ARG% OPERATION OPARGS

       OPERATION   Can be one of these: help, version, speeds, ident, erase,
                   read, write.

       OPARGS      Are arguments for selected operation. Note that the same
                   argument can have a different meaning when used with
                   different OPERATION.

Common options:
      -p PORTNAME  Name of a serial port device to use.

      -s SPEED     Serial line communication speed in Bd. Note that the
                   SPEED is a number without 'Bd' suffix. Default SPEED
                   is 19200.

      -v           Be more verbose.

      -f FREQ      CPU frequency in MHz. Real number with dot as a decimal
                   separator. This is used only by ST10F168 MCU and is
                   mandatory for it.

      -g           Print progress for read and write operations.

Operations:
    help
          Print this help message.

    version
          Print name and version information of this program.

    speeds
          Print list of serial line speeds available.

    ident
          Print name of supported MCU connected.

    erase [-b n[,n]...]
      -b n[,n]...  Numbers of sectors to erase. Without this option whole
                   FLASH memory is erased.

    read [-n COUNT] FILE
      -n COUNT     Read only COUNT bytes from address 0 instead of whole memory.

      FILE         Name of a file where to write content of memory.

    write [-e,-c] FILE
      -e           Erase whole FLASH memory before writing data. Without this
                   option only blocks which are going to be programmed are
                   erased.

      -c           Check written data by reading it back and comparing with FILE
                   data. Without this option result of write operation is
                   checked only by MCU FLASH memory controller.

      FILE         Name of a file containing data to write to MCU FLASH memory.
